moarTLS is a Browser Extension that flags non-secure links and downloads. 

Learn more about the extension in the [Announcement Blog Post](https://textplain.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/seek-and-destroy-non-secure-references-using-the-moartls-analyzer/)

Install the Edge / Chrome extension from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moartls-analyzer/ldfbacdbackkjhclmhnjabngnppnkagh)

Install the Firefox extension from the [Mozilla Addons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/moartls/?src=cb-dl-rating)

Install the Edge Legacy version from the [Microsoft Store page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/moartls-analyzer/9nw480sp5d2c#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Extension works with Opera but their store rejected the extension because they don't like mention of "Chrome" and I was too lazy to fix it.
